            <h2>How to Build with Lego</h2>
            <h3>Getting Started: Organize Your Space</h3>
            <p>Before beginning a Lego project, it's helpful to have a designated space where you can comfortably work and keep your pieces organized. A table with small bins or trays is ideal, allowing you to sort pieces by color, size, or type for easy access.</p>
        
            <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Set or Build Idea</h3>
            <p>If you're using a Lego set, start by carefully reviewing the instructions to familiarize yourself with the build process. For custom creations, sketch out your idea or gather inspiration from online communities to give your project a direction.</p>

            </figure>
        
            <h3>Step 2: Build in Layers</h3>
            <p>Building in layers is a common technique for larger structures. Start with the base, ensuring it’s strong and stable, then gradually work upwards. This method helps avoid instability and lets you focus on details layer by layer.</p>
        
            <h3>Step 3: Customize and Add Details</h3>
            <p>Once the main structure is complete, customize your build by adding small details that bring it to life. Add textures, colors, and unique features to make your creation stand out.</p>
        
            <h3>Step 4: Display or Play!</h3>
            <p>Once finished, decide if you want to display your build as a decoration or use it as part of a larger play setup. Many builders enjoy creating entire Lego worlds by combining different builds into one expansive scene.</p>
