            <h3><a href="https://www.arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren.net</a></h3>
            <p>
                This was a personal website for a web developer named Arngren which was a place to share their thoughts, images and other content. But it is mostly known for it's chaotic and cluttered design having little to no order and being completely cluttered up with photos and text. It has been around the internet for a long time and is seen as a reflection on early web style.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Despite the website having contrasting colors such as black, red, and blue on a white background some of the areas have low contrast which leads to readability issues. The low quality images and the amount of them make it difficult to focus on anything.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> It has repetition in the way that it uses the same chaotic style across all of it's pages which helps create a unique look. But despite that it is inconsistent with different photos, text, and colors appearing throughout leading to lack of unity across the pages and makes it hard to navigate.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Poor alignment throughout the pages everything is scattered across the page without any structure or grid. Which creates confusion and makes the page feel disorganized.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> A lot of elements are seemingly placed without clear grouping nor thought. Which makes it difficult to see what is actually related to each other making things feel disconnected.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://gohyer.com/" target="_blank">Hyer</a></h3>
            <p>
                Hyer is a platform for remote staffing and workforce management. Their website is very clean and professional with easy to 
                navigate pages to help show their offerings. The consistent colors and themes throughout the website help guide users throughout their website.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The contrasting colors between the text and the background help make most of the text easy to read. The call to action buttons are also in contrasting colors helping emphasize them.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Consistent use of fonts, colors, and layout elements that create a unified and professional look. The colors in particular blue accents and white and darker backgrounds help establish a cohesive look.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The website has good alignment overall. Text and images are generally aligned to grids, making it visually clean and easy to follow. </li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong>  Related content is generally grouped together. For example, headings, descriptions, and buttons are placed in proximity to each other, making it easy to identify related elements on the page.</li>
